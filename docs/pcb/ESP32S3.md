Based on the electrical diagram, we also create PCB so you can solder components to make your capibaraZero more stable and portable.

The gerber files are available [here](https://github.com/CapibaraZero/resources/tree/main/PCB/ESP32-S3-DEVKITC-1/Gerber_CapibaraZero_PCB_Main_Board_2024-04-09) and the EasyEDA project [here](https://github.com/CapibaraZero/resources/blob/main/PCB/ESP32-S3-DEVKITC-1/PCB_Main_Board_2024-04-09.json)

You also need to build the Navigation Board, for more information go [here](/docs/docs/pcb/Navigation_Board)

This PCB feature also a TP4057 charging module(LX-LBC3) that includes charging and discharging functionality. It requires a 3.7V lithium battery.
