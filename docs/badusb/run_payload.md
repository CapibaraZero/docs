To run payload, you first need to upload duckyscript in SD card under /ducky/ then you can go under BadUSB in CapibaraZero GUI and will be opened a file browser where you can select the desidered payload.

Actually file browser not support scrolling so you can upload 4-5 files max.

Once you click OK button on selected payload it will be executed and GUI will be blocked until finish(we will add stop feature soon).
