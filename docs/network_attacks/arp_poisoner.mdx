CapibaraZero's ARP poisoner is an implementation of ARP poisoning DoS through the WiFi interface. 

It will send ARP reply requests where it will announce its MAC address as default gateway of the network. 

This attack requires to know victim MAC address and IP address besides ARP reply request will update likely all ARP table of hosts in the network.

## How to make attack

- Create config.json under /arp_poisoner path like [this](/example_config/arp_poisoner/example.json) with SSID and password of AP to connect then target IP in the form of array and target MAC address in the form of array(convert HEX to decimal like the example config since JSON doesn't support HEX.)
- Go to NetAt.(Network attacks)
- Select ARPoisoner
- Attack start to run. You can stop when you want


### Convert MAC to JSON array

In order to configure ARPoisoner, you need to convert a MAC address in hexadecimal format to a decimal JSON array. Here there is a converter that can make the work for you. Put MAC in aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff form or AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF form and submit the form.
